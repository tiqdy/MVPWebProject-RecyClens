Improper waste sorting is a major challenge in effective recycling. RecycLens addresses this issue by using Artificial Intelligence (Computer Vision) to classify waste based on images uploaded or captured by users. This project serves as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to demonstrate how AI can be applied to environmental sustainability.
The application is built to be lightweight, accessible, and easy to use, making it suitable for educational purposes, demonstrations, and early-stage product validation.

✨ Features
📸 Image upload and camera capture support
🤖 AI-based waste classification
🗂️ Multiple waste categories (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic waste)
⚡ Instant classification results
🌍 Web-based and publicly accessible

⚠️ Disclaimer
This application is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. Classification results may not always be accurate and should not be used as the sole basis for real-world waste management decisions.
